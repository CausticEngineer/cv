## Experience

**R&D Disruptive Innovations, Innovations Manager, Computer Vision Engineer, Project Manager @ [MAY LLC](https://www.themay.com/en/)** <br>
_Moscow, Russia (May 2020 - Present)_ <br>

* Led development of bespoke software for automated numerical optimization of BOMs (Bill Of Materials) for planning and production, brought savings about $200+k per year.

* Invented and developed bespoke quantitative sensory assessment methodology to replace expert based BOMs management process by digital automated process.

* Led development of computer vision system for tea and coffee quantitative visual appearance assessment and QC (Quality Control).  Built segmentation pipeline using traditional computer vision, trained classification models using deep learning, build clustering models using classical machine learning.  Justified $100+k of investments in specialized hardware for research and production.

**R&D, Data Science Projects @ [MARS LLC](https://www.mars.com/)** <br>
_Moscow, Russia (September 2018 - May 2020)_ <br>

- Launch project for predicting product density by extrusion process parameters. Data Collected and linear regression trained. Proposed changes in factory measurement system for improving data quality. 
- Launch project for product detection on shelfs in trade. Collected and labeled appropriate photos, trained object detection for packaging on shelfs. <br>

**R&D, Senior Packaging Development Technologist @ [MARS LLC](https://www.mars.com/)** <br>
_Moscow, Russia (September 2014 - May 2020)_ <br>

● Generated 200 MRUB of logistic savings and 100 MRUB of packaging savings by developing and
implementing improvements in palletization scheme, case count and material dimensions.
● Initiated and led evolutionary tree creation process for existent and potential future packaging concepts by applying TRIZ methodologies.
● Developed unique heavy (100 kg) store-ready kit for pouch products and supported rollout in Tander
grocery chain. Organized three X-functional innovation sessions with Sales, Marketing, R&D and
packaging supplier representative that led to this solution.
● Persuaded to purchase 3D-printer for packaging development and trained all technologists to use it.
● Developed zero CAPEX and easy to implement alternative solution for shelf visibility improvement of
existing secondary pouch packaging (brand new solution for all known markets).
● Supported pouch to EU export project by developing three European like packaging types starting from
drawings to real prototypes and palletization schemes, successfully tested and agreed for implementation. <br>
